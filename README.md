Project by Laurent Richter.

Initiated by OpenClassRooms.


This is a Labyrinthe Game based on .txt maps (placed in the 'cartes' folder). 

The whole code is in the 'labyrinthes' folder actually.

The 'roboc.py' is the main file to run.

If you have any suggestion, do not hesitate to disturb myself.
